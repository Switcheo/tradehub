# MainNet v1.6.0 -> v1.8.0 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v1.6.0 to v1.8.0 as well as upgrade the node installation architecture to include the `cosmovisor` daemon, which will facilitate future upgrades to be more seamless and automatic.

You can read more about cosmovisor [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/cosmovisor).

The v1.8.0 is our first "hard fork" upgrade and is scheduled for [block 2280000](https://switcheo.org/blocks).

**:exclamation: Before beginning, here are some important things to note: :exclamation:**

- Ensure your node has been updated with steps in Phase A **before block 2,280,000**.
- **Do not** apply [Phase B](#phase-b-cleanup-your-node-installation-after-v180-is-live) until **after** the upgrade is live at block 2,280,000.
- Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps!

## Phase A: Upgrade your v1.6.0 installation to the v1.6.0+comovisor configuration

The following steps will use the [v1.8.0 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/tradehub/releases/tag/v1.8.0) to upgrade your node to v1.6.0+cosmovisor (legacy v1.6.0 binary with an additional `cosmovisor` binary) first, and await for the v1.8.0 upgrade. Cosmovisor daemon will automatically kill the v1.6.0 binary and switch to the v1.8.0 binary on block 2,280,000.

1. Update `~/.env_switcheo` to with the new environment variables needed to support `cosmovisor`.

    ```bash
    # remove
    export MINFDS=<value>
    # add
    export WALLET_PASSWORD=# this is correctly meant to be left blank
    export DAEMON_NAME=switcheod
    export DAEMON_HOME=${HOME}/.switcheod
    export PATH=${HOME}/.switcheod/cosmovisor/current/bin:${HOME}/.switcheod/cosmovisor/genesis/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
    ```

2. Setup `systemctl` for better support of `cosmovisor`. We will migrate away from `supervisorctl` and remove it later.

    ```bash
    # setup switcheod config
    sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/switcheod.service && \
    CURRENT_USER=$USER \
    sudo -E bash -c 'cat <<EOT >> /etc/systemd/system/switcheod.service
    [Unit]
    Description=switcheod service
    After=network.target
    StartLimitIntervalSec=0
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=5
    User=${CURRENT_USER}
    ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "source ~/.env_switcheo; killall -w -s 9 switcheod switcheocli; cosmovisor start-all -a"
    LimitNOFILE=64000
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    EOT
    '
    ```

3. Prepare cosmovisor `directories`

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/genesis/bin ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades
    ```

4. Restart your shell

    ```bash
    exec $SHELL
    ```

5. Download and upgrade using the v1.8.0 release bundle

    The [v1.8.0 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/tradehub/releases/tag/v1.8.0) contains both the v1.6.0+cosmovisor and v1.8.0 binaries.

    We will be placing v1.6.0+cosmovisor binaries (`switcheod` / `switcheocli`) in the `genesis` directory, and the v1.8.0 binaries in upgrades directory. Cosmovisor will switch to the right binary during the upgrade block height.

    ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/Switcheo/tradehub/releases/download/v1.8.0/install-mainnet.tar.gz | tar -xz
    cd install-mainnet && sudo ./install.sh && cd - && rm -rf install-mainnet

    sudo supervisorctl stop switcheod

    # switcheod and switcheocli will be available in ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/
    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/switcheod
    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/switcheocli
    sudo cp /etc/switcheoctl/bin/cosmovisor /usr/local/bin
    sudo cp /etc/switcheoctl/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/switcheod ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
    sudo cp /etc/switcheoctl/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/switcheocli ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
    mkdir -p ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.8.0/bin
    sudo cp /etc/switcheoctl/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.8.0/bin/switcheod ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.8.0/bin
    sudo cp /etc/switcheoctl/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.8.0/bin/switcheocli ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.8.0/bin

    # sentry node, non-validator node or
    switcheoctl start -n
    # validator node
    switcheoctl start

    # check that chain is progressing, there should be no errors. it might take up to 30s to reconnect.
    tail -f ~/.switcheo_logs/*
    ```

6. Check that you are running the correct node version: `v1.6.0+cosmovisor`

    Ensure that you're running v1.6.0+cosmovisor, rather than v1.8.0, as the v1.8.0 upgrade has yet to take place.

    ```bash
    # check version is patched correctly
    curl -s localhost:1318/node_info | jq -r '.application_version.version'
    ```

    Note that v1.8.0 will be running automatically after block 2280000. You may check the version of your node again after block 2280000.

7. Check that you have configured the right versions of `switcheod` for `cosmovisor` to switch over correctly.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` and `usr/local/bin` directories:

    ```bash
    $ openssl sha256 ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/switcheod
    # e1b6361bf5ec06c336540ea7a088ec82c3769f0c187f4138b8c98c4221a6e3b0
    $ openssl sha256 ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.8.0/bin/switcheod
    # 198d9c2ac9c366c0574a2217b20af81fb3f541495fb78d06cdf7b4988a6a5e42
    $ openssl sha256 /usr/local/bin/cosmovisor
    # 23c8533be6bacec16decef9f7b6b51557c5ad14d11766437213ec255bddff83c
    ```

    Ensure that cosmovisor has a symbolic link to the correct binary version:

    ```bash
    $ ls -l ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/
    # current -> $HOME/.switcheod/cosmovisor/genesis
    ```

8. Remove `supervisorctl`.

    We are deprecating the use of `supervisor` and will use `systemd` together with `cosmovisor`, so you may uninstall it:

    ```bash
    # remove supervisorctl
    sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove -y supervisor
    sudo rm -f /etc/supervisor/conf.d/switcheod.conf
    ```

## Phase B: Cleanup your node installation after v1.8.0 is live

These steps should be performed **after** v1.8.0 is live after block 2,280,000, as they will cause the app to break if they are applied before that.

Update log file locations for logrotate in `/etc/logrotate.d/switcheo_logs`:

```conf
# Remove:
$HOME/.switcheo_logs/*.log ${HOME}/.switcheo_logs/*.err {
    olddir ${HOME}/.switcheo_logs/old

# And add:
${HOME}/.switcheod/logs/*.log ${HOME}/.switcheod/logs/*.err {
    olddir ${HOME}/.switcheod/logs/old
```

Update config file locations:

```bash
# Copy these if ~/.switcheod/config/fee.json, ~/.switcheod/config/ethpayer.json, ~/.switcheod/config/extevents.json doesn't exist
cp /etc/switcheoctl/etc/.switcheod/config/fee.json ~/.switcheod/config/
cp /etc/switcheoctl/etc/.switcheod/config/ethpayer.json ~/.switcheod/config/
cp /etc/switcheoctl/etc/.switcheod/config/extevents.json ~/.switcheod/config/

# restart the node:
switcheoctl stop
# For sentry node, non-validator node:
switcheoctl start -n
# OR for validator node:
switcheoctl start
```
