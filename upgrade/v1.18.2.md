# MainNet v1.18.0 -> v1.18.2 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v1.18.2 to v1.18.2 and fix the chain halt at block 13005153. The binaries must be placed in `~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.18.0` directory so that cosmovisor will start with the right binaries.

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v1.18.2 release bundle.

    The [v1.18.2 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/tradehub/releases/tag/v1.18.2) contains v1.18.2 binaries.

    We will be placing v1.18.2 binaries (`switcheod` / `switcheocli`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.18.0` directory. Cosmovisor will switch to the right binary during the upgrade block height.

    ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/Switcheo/tradehub/releases/download/v1.18.2/install-mainnet.tar.gz | tar -xz
    cd install-mainnet && sudo ./install.sh && cd - && rm -rf install-mainnet

    switcheoctl stop

    # place v1.18.2 binaries into upgrades/v1.18.0 directory
    sudo cp /etc/switcheoctl/bin/switcheod ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.18.0/bin
    sudo cp /etc/switcheoctl/bin/switcheocli ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.18.0/bin

    # ensure that you have installed the right binary, do not proceed if it's different.
    openssl sha256 ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.18.0/bin/switcheod
    # 1399db5d7b49ea6bef35b08d481b996a0e60bbcb982fb545dee09826c52a10e8

    # sentry node, non-validator node or
    switcheoctl start -n
    # validator node
    switcheoctl start
    ```

    Note that v1.18.2 will be running automatically after block 12632850. You may check the version of your node after block 12632850.

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `switcheod` for `cosmovisor` to switch over correctly.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` and `usr/local/bin` directories:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.18.0/bin/switcheod
    # 1399db5d7b49ea6bef35b08d481b996a0e60bbcb982fb545dee09826c52a10e8
    ```
