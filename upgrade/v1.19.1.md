# MainNet v1.19.0 -> v1.19.1 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v1.19.0 to v1.19.1 and fix the chain halt at block 15090290. The binaries must be placed in `~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.19.0` directory so that cosmovisor will start with the right binaries.

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v1.19.1 release bundle.

    The [v1.19.1 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/tradehub/releases/tag/v1.19.1) contains v1.19.1 binaries.

    We will be placing v1.19.1 binaries (`switcheod` / `switcheocli`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.19.0` directory. Cosmovisor will switch to the right binary during the upgrade block height.

    ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/Switcheo/tradehub/releases/download/v1.19.1/install-mainnet.tar.gz | tar -xz
    cd install-mainnet && sudo ./install.sh && cd - && rm -rf install-mainnet

    switcheoctl stop

    # place v1.19.1 binaries into upgrades/v1.19.0 directory
    sudo cp /etc/switcheoctl/bin/switcheod ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.19.0/bin
    sudo cp /etc/switcheoctl/bin/switcheocli ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.19.0/bin

    # ensure that you have installed the right binary, do not proceed if it's different.
    openssl sha256 ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.19.0/bin/switcheod
    # a8a78178190f470da620b8b4ddd17b3f707a4967c1b1fd49e592dfa4a9bf451f

    # sentry node, non-validator node or
    switcheoctl start -n
    # validator node
    switcheoctl start
    ```

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `switcheod` for `cosmovisor` to switch over correctly.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` and `usr/local/bin` directories:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.19.0/bin/switcheod
    # a8a78178190f470da620b8b4ddd17b3f707a4967c1b1fd49e592dfa4a9bf451f
    ```
