# MainNet v1.14.x -> v1.15.0 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v1.14.x to v1.15.0, and pre-download v1.15.0 upgrade binaries. The binaries must be placed in `~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.15.0` directory so that cosmovisor will switch to the right binaries at v1.15.0 upgrade block height.

The v1.15.0 upgrade will be scheduled for [block 8745950](https://switcheo.org/blocks).

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v1.15.0 release bundle.

    The [v1.15.0 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/tradehub/releases/tag/v1.15.0) contains v1.15.0 binaries.

    We will be placing v1.15.0 binaries (`switcheod` / `switcheocli`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.15.0` directory. Cosmovisor will switch to the right binary during the upgrade block height.

    ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/Switcheo/tradehub/releases/download/v1.15.0/install-mainnet.tar.gz | tar -xz
    cd install-mainnet && sudo ./install.sh && cd - && rm -rf install-mainnet

    # place pre-download v1.15.0 binaries into upgrades/v1.15.0 directory
    sudo cp -r /etc/switcheoctl/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.15.0 ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades
    ```

    Note that v1.15.0 will be running automatically after block 8745950. You may check the version of your node after block 8745950.

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `switcheod` for `cosmovisor` to switch over correctly.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` and `usr/local/bin` directories:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.switcheod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.15.0/bin/switcheod
    # 4a8095fb17d7ef550215b47a3a6e608f0d0795c11f6edd18af2c0d976bc24e94
    ```

3. Update `~/.switcheod/config/config.toml` in your validator node

    You can skip this if your `timeout_propose` is already "3s".

    ```bash
    # update timeout_propose to "3s"
    vim ~/.switcheod/config/config.toml
    ```

    So that the file look like this:

    **Do not copy and paste the lines below into your shell**
    ```bash
    ...
    timeout_propose = "3s"
    timeout_propose_delta = "500ms"
    timeout_prevote = "1s"
    timeout_prevote_delta = "500ms"
    timeout_precommit = "1s"
    timeout_precommit_delta = "500ms"
    timeout_commit = "1s"
    ...
    ```
